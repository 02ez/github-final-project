## PRFAQ

### Problem
Current repository lacks enterprise-grade security controls, compliance measures, and automated governance required for regulated production environments. Missing SBOM generation, provenance tracking, comprehensive security scanning, and proper access controls.

### Alternatives Rejected
- Manual security reviews only: Too error-prone and not scalable
- Basic CI without security scanning: Insufficient for compliance requirements
- Third-party security tools only: Vendor lock-in and integration complexity

### User Impact
- Developers get automated security feedback in CI/CD pipeline
- Security teams get comprehensive visibility into vulnerabilities and supply chain
- Compliance teams get audit trail and attestations for regulatory requirements
- Operations teams get observability and monitoring capabilities

### Operations Impact
- Automated security scanning reduces manual review overhead
- SBOM generation provides complete dependency visibility
- Provenance tracking enables supply chain attestation
- Canary deployments reduce production incident risk

### Security Posture
- Multi-layered security scanning (Trivy, Semgrep, TruffleHog)
- Container image signing with cosign
- SLSA Level 3 provenance generation
- Automated dependency vulnerability detection
- Secret scanning in code and containers

### Rollout Plan
1. Phase 1: Implement CI/CD workflows and security scanning
2. Phase 2: Add SBOM generation and container signing
3. Phase 3: Enable deployment automation with gates
4. Phase 4: Full observability and monitoring integration

### Rollback Plan
- Git revert to previous stable commit
- Disable new workflows via GitHub repository settings
- Restore previous CODEOWNERS and branch protection rules
- 1-click rollback available through GitHub deployments

### Timebox
- Implementation: 2 weeks
- Testing and validation: 1 week
- Documentation and training: 1 week
- Total timeline: 4 weeks

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Script usage unchanged: `./simple-interest.sh -p <principal> -r <rate_%> -t <years>`
- Docker usage unchanged: `docker run simple-interest -p 1000 -r 5 -t 2`
- No breaking changes to existing integrations

## Security and Compliance

### Threat Model

| Threat | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Code injection via user input | High | Low | Input validation, shellcheck, sandboxed execution |
| Supply chain compromise | High | Medium | SBOM, provenance, vulnerability scanning |
| Secrets in code | Medium | Medium | TruffleHog scanning, pre-commit hooks |
| Container vulnerabilities | High | Medium | Trivy scanning, distroless base images |
| Unauthorized code changes | Medium | Low | Branch protection, required reviews, CODEOWNERS |
| Malicious dependencies | High | Low | Dependabot, vulnerability database integration |

### Secret Management
- OIDC-based authentication eliminates long-lived keys
- AWS role assumption via GitHub OIDC provider
- Container registry authentication via GitHub token
- Cosign keyless signing with Sigstore

### SBOM Generation
```bash
# Generate Software Bill of Materials
syft packages dir:. -o spdx-json=sbom-spdx.json
syft packages dir:. -o cyclonedx-json=sbom-cyclonedx.json
syft packages dir:. -o syft-json=sbom-syft.json
```

### SLSA Provenance
```bash
# Verify provenance
slsa-verifier verify-image $IMAGE@$DIGEST \
  --source-uri github.com/02ez/github-final-project \
  --source-tag $TAG
```

### Security Controls Enabled
- [x] CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities
- [x] Trivy scanning for container and filesystem vulnerabilities
- [x] Semgrep for static analysis security testing
- [x] TruffleHog for secret detection
- [x] Dependabot for dependency vulnerability management
- [x] Branch protection with required reviews
- [x] Signed commits enforcement (DCO)

### Required Policies
- Branch protection: 2 required approving reviews, dismiss stale reviews
- Required status checks: build-test-lint, security-scan
- Enforce admins: true
- Restrict pushes: only via pull requests
- Signed commits: required

## Testing Plan

```bash
bats test/simple-interest.bats
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test Docker container
docker build -t simple-interest .
docker run simple-interest -p 1000 -r 5 -t 2
```

## Forecast Log

### Key Risks with Probabilities
1. **Container signing complexity** (30% probability): Implementation of cosign and SLSA provenance may require additional integration work
2. **Security scanning false positives** (25% probability): May need to tune security tools to reduce noise and improve signal
3. **Compliance documentation gaps** (20% probability): Additional documentation may be required for specific regulatory requirements
4. **Performance impact from security scans** (15% probability): Security scanning may slow down CI/CD pipeline beyond acceptable thresholds
5. **Team adoption resistance** (10% probability): Development team may need additional training on new security workflows

*Note: Risk probabilities will be scored using Brier score methodology after implementation completion.*
