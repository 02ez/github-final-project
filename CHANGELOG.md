## Version Comparison

| Version | Lines of Code | Features | Tests | Documentation |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------|---------------|
| 0.1.0   | 12           | 1        | 0     | Basic         |

## Migration Guide

### From 0.1.0 to 1.0.0

The 1.0.0 release maintains 100% backward compatibility with 0.1.0. All existing commands will continue to work exactly as before:

```bash
# This works in both 0.1.0 and 1.0.0
./simple-interest.sh -p 1000 -r 5 -t 2
```

New features are available through additional flags and options, but the core interface remains unchanged.

#### New Capabilities Available
- Use `-c` for compound interest calculations
- Use `-f json` or `-f csv` for structured output
- Use `-u EUR` (or other currency codes) for currency formatting
- Use `-i` for interactive mode
- Use `-v` for verbose output
- Use `-h` for comprehensive help

#### Breaking Changes
- None - full backward compatibility maintained

#### Dependencies
- BC calculator is now required (was already required in 0.1.0)
- Bash 4.0+ recommended (was implicitly required)
