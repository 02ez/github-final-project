# Project Governance

## Overview

This document outlines the governance structure and decision-making processes for the Simple Interest Calculator project.

## Project Vision

To provide a production-ready, secure, and well-documented command-line tool for financial calculations that serves as a reference implementation for shell scripting best practices.

## Governance Model

This project follows a **Benevolent Dictator** model with community input and transparency.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Project Maintainer
- **Current**: @02ez
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Final decision authority on technical direction
  - Release management and versioning
  - Security vulnerability response
  - Community guidelines enforcement
  - Code review and merge decisions

#### Contributors
- **Definition**: Anyone who has submitted accepted contributions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Follow project coding standards
  - Participate in code reviews
  - Report issues and suggest improvements
  - Help with documentation and testing

#### Community Members
- **Definition**: Users, supporters, and interested parties
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Provide feedback and use cases
  - Report bugs and security issues
  - Participate in discussions
  - Help other users

## Decision Making Process

### Technical Decisions
1. **Minor Changes**: Maintainer discretion
2. **Feature Additions**: Community discussion → Maintainer decision
3. **Breaking Changes**: RFC process → Community feedback → Maintainer decision
4. **Architecture Changes**: RFC process → Extended community feedback → Maintainer decision

### Process Flow
```
Issue/Proposal → Discussion → RFC (if needed) → Implementation → Review → Merge
```

## RFC Process

For significant changes, we use a Request for Comments (RFC) process:

1. **Create RFC**: Open an issue with [RFC] prefix
2. **Community Input**: 1-2 week discussion period
3. **Decision**: Maintainer makes final decision
4. **Implementation**: Approved RFCs can be implemented

### RFC Criteria
- Breaking changes to public API
- New major features
- Architecture modifications
- Security policy changes

## Communication Channels

### Primary Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions, ideas, announcements
- **Pull Requests**: Code changes and reviews
- **Security Advisories**: Security-related issues

### Communication Guidelines
- Be respectful and constructive
- Use appropriate channels for different types of communication
- Search existing issues/discussions before creating new ones
- Provide clear, detailed information

## Contribution Process

### For Contributors
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch
3. **Make** changes following coding standards
4. **Test** thoroughly with existing test suite
5. **Submit** pull request with clear description
6. **Respond** to feedback during review process

### For Maintainers
1. **Review** contributions for quality, security, and alignment
2. **Provide** constructive feedback
3. **Merge** approved contributions
4. **Release** new versions as appropriate

## Code of Conduct

All community members must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT). Violations will be addressed according to the enforcement guidelines outlined in that document.

## Conflict Resolution

### Process
1. **Direct Communication**: Encourage direct, respectful discussion
2. **Maintainer Mediation**: Escalate to project maintainer if needed
3. **Community Input**: Seek broader community perspective for persistent issues
4. **Final Decision**: Maintainer makes final decision if consensus cannot be reached

### Appeals
- Decisions can be appealed through GitHub discussions
- Appeals should present new information or demonstrate procedural errors
- Maintainer will reconsider with community input

## Release Management

### Versioning
- Follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Major.Minor.Patch format (e.g., 1.0.0)

### Release Process
1. **Version Planning**: Based on accumulated changes
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across supported platforms
3. **Documentation**: Update changelog and documentation
4. **Release**: Create GitHub release with notes
5. **Announcement**: Notify community through appropriate channels

### Release Cadence
- **Patch**: As needed for bug fixes (weekly if needed)
- **Minor**: Monthly for new features
- **Major**: Quarterly or as needed for breaking changes

## Security Governance

### Security Team
- **Lead**: Project maintainer
- **Process**: Defined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- **Response Time**: 24-48 hours for critical issues

### Security Decisions
- Security fixes take priority over other development
- Security-related breaking changes may be released without normal RFC process
- Community notification follows responsible disclosure principles

## Project Evolution

### Long-term Vision
- Maintain focus on core financial calculation functionality
- Evolve toward comprehensive financial toolkit
- Preserve backward compatibility
- Maintain high code quality and security standards

### Governance Evolution
This governance model may evolve as the project grows:
- **Small Project** (current): Benevolent dictator model
- **Medium Project**: Core team with specialized roles
- **Large Project**: Technical steering committee

## Amendments

This governance document can be updated through the standard RFC process:
1. Propose changes via GitHub issue with [GOVERNANCE] prefix
2. Community discussion period (minimum 2 weeks)
3. Maintainer decision with rationale
4. Update document and announce changes
