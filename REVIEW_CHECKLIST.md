## Waiver Process

If any checklist item cannot be completed:

1. Document the specific item and reason for waiver
2. Assess risk impact and mitigation measures
3. Obtain approval from appropriate authority:
   - Security items: Security team lead approval
   - Infrastructure items: DevOps team lead approval
   - Business items: Product owner approval
4. Set expiry date for waiver (max 30 days)
5. Create follow-up issue to address waived item

## Emergency Override

In case of critical production issues requiring immediate deployment:

1. Incident commander can override checklist requirements
2. Must document override reason and approving authority
3. Post-incident review must address skipped items
4. Follow-up PR required within 48 hours to address gaps
